现在是5点，到了下班时间。我把一些文件放进包里，拿起杯子，对周围的同事说再见。我走到停车场进到车里。我打信号灯进入街道往高速匝道开去。我尽最大努力汇入高速，在这个时候总是有点困难。从市中心开始交通一路上很拥堵。我从收音机里听到在La Brea附近的快车道上有一辆车抛锚了，阻塞交通一直到胡佛。我决定下高速剩下的路走地面街道。
在回家的路上我需要停一下。我知道冰箱是空的，所以决定停在超市门口。我到那里并拿了一些法国面包，一袋苹果，一些香蕉，一些意面，番茄酱，和一只做好的鸡。幸运的是，有很多收银台开着，我很快就通过了队伍。我感谢了收银员和打包员，把推车推到我的车旁。我打开后备箱，把所有东西装上车。就在那时我老婆给我打电话。她要晚点回家并叫我准备一些东西当晚餐。今晚，我将是厨师。
It's five o'clock and it's quitting time. I put a few files into my bag, grab my mug, and say goodnight to the rest of the people **in** my area. I **go** to the parking garage and get into my car. I signal my turn onto the street and **drive** toward the freeway onramp. I merge as best as I can **onto** the freeway , **which is always** a bit of hassle at this hour. Traffic is stop-and-go all the way from **downtown**. I hear on the raido that there is a stalled car **in** fastlane near La Brea. backing up traffic **all the way** to Hoover. I decide to get off the freeway and to take surface streets for the rest of the trip.
I need to make a stop on the way home. I know that the fridge is empty, so I decide to stop by the market. I get there and pick up some French bread, a bag of **apples**, a few **bananas**, some pasta, tomato sauce, and a cooked kitchen. Luckily, they have a lot of checkout stands open, I get through the line **pretty** quickly. I thank the cashier and the bagger and push my cart to my car. I open the trunk and load everything up. **Just then** my wife calls me **on my cell phone**. she was going to be a little late getting home and asks me to make something for dinner. Tonight, I'll be the cook.
