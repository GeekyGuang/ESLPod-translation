我回到卧室并打开衣橱的门。我有30件工作衬衫，10条裤子，半打领带，和一些毛衣，工作外套和T恤。我拿出一双干净的袜子和内裤，然后决定今天要穿哪件衬衫。我不擅长颜色搭配，所以我通常在这个时候把老婆叫进来帮我搭配衬衫和裤子。我穿上有银色搭扣的皮带并擦亮鞋子。我把手机和车钥匙放在前面的口袋，我的钱包放在后面的口袋。
我带上眼镜并在镜子前检查我自己，确保我看起来不错，然后进到家庭办公室拿我的包。我过去常常带一个更传统的公文包，但现在我仅仅用我的电脑包来装我的平板和我的文件。现在回到厨房拿我的保温杯走到外面的路上。我锁上门然后匆匆去往在车库的车。我经常迟到，今天也不例外。

I go back into my bedroom and open up closet door. I have 30 dress shirts, 10 pairs of pants, a half-dozen ties, and some sweaters, suit jackets and T-shirts. I pull out a clean pair of socks and underwear, and then decide which shirt to I'm going to wear today. I'm terrible at color coordinating, so I usually bring my wife in at his point to help match shirt and pants.I put on my belt with a silver buckle and polish my shoes. I put my cell phone and car keys in my front pocket, and my wallet in the back one.
I put on my glasses and check myself in the mirror to make sure I look okay, and go into my home office to get my bag. I used to carry a more traditional briefcase, but now I just use my computer bag to hold my laptop and papers.Now it's back to the kitchen to grab my Thermos on the way out the door. I lock the door and hurry to my car in the garage. I'm usually running late and today is no exception.
