当我到家的时候，我立刻开始准备晚餐。把杂货放一边之后我清理干净厨房台面并决定做意面。我预热炉子到 375 度去烘烤面包并将鸡保温知道我妻子回家。我放一些水到平底锅并把炉火调高。当水开始沸腾的时候，我放入意面并决定做一个沙拉。就在那时，我妻子打开后面，叫到，我回家了。她进入厨房，帮忙切土豆放入调味汁。她搅拌沙司直到完成，在我完成摇晃沙拉的时候。
我拿出餐垫和餐巾纸布置桌子。我也确定那里有勺子，刀叉和盘子给每个人。大于 15 分钟之后，我们坐在餐厅的桌旁讲我们漫长的一天。我妻子说她将洗碗，因为我做饭了。但是当然我帮忙擦干它们。首先，我把一些剩菜放入特百惠，一些放入保鲜袋，剩下的放入铝箔。然后我擦干平底锅，盘子，杯子和餐具。

when I get home, I start on dinner right away. I clean off the kitchen counter after I **putting** away the groceries and decide to make pasta. I preheat the oven to 375 to bake the bread and to keep the chicken hot until my wife gets home. I put some water in a pan and **turn** the burner on high. when the water **starts boiling**, I put in the pasta and decide to make a salad. Just then, my wife opens the back door and yells, I'm home. she comes into the kitchen, and **helps with chopping the tamatoes** and add to the sauce. she stirs the sauce untill it's done while I finish tossing the salad.
I **get out** the place mats and napkins to set the table. I also make sure that there is a spoon, knife, fork and plate for each of us. about 15 minutes later, we sit down at the table in the dinning room and talk about our long day. my wife says she'll do the dishes, **since** I cooked. but of course I **help out by** drying them. first, I put some leftovers in a tupperware container and some in plastic wrap, and the rest in aluminum foil. Then I dry the pans, plates, glasses and silverware.
