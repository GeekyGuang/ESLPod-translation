我走进厨房打开咖啡机，我总是在昨晚放进咖啡，滤纸，和水所以现在一切就绪。下一步，我打开放着燕麦的碗橱的门，每天早上的早餐我都喜欢吃火腿和鸡蛋，或者也许一叠华夫饼，但真相是我没有时间做饭

所以我给自己到了一碗燕麦并且放进一杯脱脂牛奶，确保我从餐具托盘中拿了一个勺子。我走到外面拿起我的报纸，坐在餐桌旁。我喜欢在早上读报纸，尽管我常常只有时间读一些故事。当我吃完了燕麦，我抓一个香蕉或者也许做一块有果酱的土司。我在水槽里冲洗早餐的碟子并把他们放进洗碗机。到那时候，我的咖啡就好了所以我给自己倒一杯剩下的放进保温杯里准备工作喝。

I walk into my kitchen and turn on the **coffeemaker**, I always put the coffee, filter and water in the night before so it's ready to go. next, I open the door of the cupboard where the cereal is stored, I would like ham and egg for breakfast every morning, or maybe a stack of waffles, but the truth is that I just don't have the time to cook.
so I pour myself a bowl of cereal and put in **a glass of skim milk**, making sure I take a spoon out of the **silverware** tray. I go outside and **pick up** my newspaper and sit down at the kitchen table. I love reading the paper in the morning, though usually I just have time to read a few of the stories. when I've finished the cereal, I grab a banana or maybe make **a slice of toast** with jam. I rinse the breakfast dishes in the sink and put them in the **dishwasher**. By that time, my coffee is ready, so I pour myself a cup and put the rest in a Thermos for work.
