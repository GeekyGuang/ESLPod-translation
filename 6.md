我打开车门并把公文包扔在后座，然后让自己感到舒适准备开车。我把我的咖啡杯放在杯托上，把钥匙插进打火器，找到油门，发动汽车。我妻子昨晚开车了，所以我要重新调整后视镜和侧镜。我打开收音机收听开车时间交通广播。我把挡位从停车调到倒车，倒出车道进入街道，关闭车库门，开始行驶。我过去常常开手动挡，但当我变老了，我越来越喜欢自动挡。
我通常走高速去办公室，所以我驶入匝道并开到我要下车的地方。我的办公室离出口只有几英里远。我驶入停车场，刷我的卡进入。我停车，拿好我的公文包和咖啡，径直走向电梯。而那只花了我40分钟。

I open my car door and throw my briefcase in the back seat, and get comfortable for my drive. I put my coffee mug into the cup holder, put the keys in the ignition, find the gas pedal and start the car. My wife drove the car last night, so I have to re-adjust the rear view mirror and the side mirrors. I turn on the radio to listen to the drive time traffic report. **I take the transmission out of park and into reverse**, **back out** into the driveway into the street, close the garage door and **put the car into drive**. I used to drive a stick shift, but as I get older, I like my automatic transmission more and more.
I usually take the freeway to the office, so I get on the onramp for the freeway and drive to where I have to get off. My office is only a few miles from the exit. I pull into the parking garage, swiping my key card to get in. I park, grab my briefcase and coffee, and head toward the elevator. And that only took 40 minutes.
