在去办公室的路上，我一直在想我今天的日程表上有什么。当我到我的办公桌时，在我的收件箱有一叠新的备忘和文件。当我打开电脑，我看到至少2打邮件需要浏览。正当我准备看邮件的时候，我的电话响了。是我的项目经理，朱莉，叫我进去和总部进行电话会议。我将近2小时后才回到座位。那时，我已经准备休息一下了。

10点30分，我下到休息室从饮水机里取一些热水泡茶。有一对人在休息，吃从贩卖机里买的点心，读公告栏的新通知。我碰到了Sam,一位我工作上最好的朋友，在回去工作前我们聊了一会儿。

没过过久，午餐时间到了。我通常带午餐上班在座位上吃。如果我没有时间打包午餐，我有时到街对面点外卖。唯一的麻烦是，午餐时间总是很忙我总是不得不排队。那通常很痛苦。星期五，我常常和几个工作上的朋友到外面吃午餐。在平常的星期五，我们可以放松一下。

on the way to the office, I was thinking about what I have in my agenda today. when I get to my desk, there **is** a stack of new memos and papers in my inbox. when I **turn on** my computer, I see at least two-dozen emails I need to go through. **Just as** I **start in** on the email, my phone rings. It's my project manager, Julie, asking me to come in for a conference call with our head office. I don't get back to my desk for nearly two hours. **By that time**, I was ready for a break.

at 10:30, I head down to the break room and get some hot water at the water cooler to make some tea. there were a couple of other people on break, having snacks **out of** the vending machine and reading the new notices on the bulletin board. I **run into** Sam, one of my friends **at work**, and we chat a little before **going** back to work.

Before long, it's time for lunch. I usually bring my lunch with me to work and eat it at my desk. If I have no time to pack a lunch, I sometimes go across the street for some take-out. the only trouble is, it's always so busy during the lunch hour and I always have to **stand in line**. That's usually a pain. on Fridays, I usually go out to lunch with a few friends from work. on casual Fridays, we can kick back a little and take it easy.
